# overthewire_bandit_solutions
Over The Wire Bandit solutions as will be completed during learning sessions

Start [here](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/ 'Bandit Level 0')

Stuck? Either check the files in this repo or go [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1H1sBF1VAKUsYdQd94dO9MgSaY2p1AJ4 'John Hammond Answers Playlist')


Note: going to save all solutions in markdown just because it's not a format I've used before and it would be nice to know since it's the default for GitHub readme files. (and it is just a plaintext option for the solutions that are going to be, well, plaintext)
